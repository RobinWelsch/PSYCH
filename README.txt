# PSYCHThis course is designed to be a supplementary review for any Psychology Research Methods class for undergraduate students. It is heavy on concept learning, with small lessons on how to code answers and how to manipulate data.This course is recommended to be run in RStudio. Please download R- https://www.r-project.org/ and RStudio - https://www.rstudio.com/ first.This course requires you also install the swirl package. Once RStudio has loaded, type "install.packages("swirl") into the console. Then, once it is installed, type "library(swirl)". To install this course, please run install_course("PSYCH"). You can also directly install from my github with install_course_github("krcarriere", "PSYCH").## For TeachersIf you are a teacher looking to use this course in your classroom, please follow the following instructions.1) Fork this repo.2) In each lesson, there is a customTests.R file.
