### Author

- Kevin R. Carriere

### Description

This course is meant to be paired with an Undergraduate Research Methods or Statistics course. It is meant to help teach students statistics using R in an interactive framework. I also take open data papers from Psychological Science to use to explain concepts, and help students build the same graphs that are shown in the papers.
